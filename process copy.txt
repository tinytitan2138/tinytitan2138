Process: An instance of a program (e.g a Python interpreter)
+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Separate memory space -> Memory is not shared between processes
+ Great for CPU-bound processing
+ New process is stated independently of other processes
+ Processes are interruptable/killable
+ One GIl for each process -> avoids GIL limitation

- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
- More memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
