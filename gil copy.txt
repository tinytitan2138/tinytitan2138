GIl: Global interpreter lock
- A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in Python

-Needed in CPython because memory management is not thread-safe

-Avoid:
    -Use multiprocessing
    -Use a different, free-threaded python implementation (Jython, IronPython)
    -Use a Python as a wrapper for third-party libraries (C/C++) -> numpy, scipy
