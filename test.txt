To be honest with myself, Morbius is probably the best and my most 2nd favorite installment in Sony's Spider-Man Universe along with number 1 being Venom: Let There Be Carnage but I'm not sure why everyone else disapprove this film so much. Of course some film critics claim that it's considered "uninspired and dated" but to me the film does a good job by going deep inside the backstory of Michael Morbius of how he actually became a doctor and the living vampire himself. I think the main reason that people gave it so much dislikes was because of the film's lack of structure and reasonable script which had critics leaving a result that that the scenes seemed incomplete, poorly edited and incomprehensible in their perspectives. Although when I first saw this film in theaters, I wasn't disappointed as most people were in which means I enjoyed the film. Both Jared Leto and Matt Smith are awesome as Michael and Milo Morbius including Fast & Furious actor Tyrese Gibson who plays Simon Stroud, an FBI agent who hunts and tracks down Morbius. The film combines both action and horror and which lead it to getting a few bit of praises. All of the dreary and dark vibes from the film are even effective enough in building the characters including their motivations. If your like any villians from Spider-Man then I suggest you give Morbius a watch. Gonna give this film 5 vampire bats.
